            	<h1><b>Contracts Review Checklist</b></h1>

				<p>Checklists are an essential tool to assist in the successful selection, contracts review, and implementation of dental software. We have developed these checklists over a 15 year period of successfully assisting practices in these areas.</p>
                <p id="disclaimer"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note:</span> The following items are meant only as a guideline to some of the contractual items to be aware of depending on your individual situation. This is not an exhaustive list and is not meant as a substitute for professional consultation on contractual matters.</p>

              <h4><b>Warranties and Guarantees</b></h4>
              <div class="panel-group" id="warrantiesGuarantees">
                   <div class="panel panel-default">
                     <div class="panel-heading">
                       <h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#warrantiesGuarantees" href="#collapseOne1" onclick="dropdown(One1)"><span id="One1" class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></span> Meaningful Use</a></h4>
                     </div>
                     <div id="collapseOne1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                       <div class="panel-body"><p>Meaningful Use (If applicable)
Eligible professionals who wish to attest for meaningful use need to write guarantees into the contract that the vendor will provide necessary functionality. In particular, certification is crucial to receiving the incentive and reimbursement, and that is a vendor responsibility. Vendors are rarely responsible for the receipt or actual payment of reimbursements, but ensuring that the software is eligible can be their responsibility. Each customer is responsible for accurate and complete reporting, communication and follow-through with the government program. In particular, practices should consider what stage or stages of meaningful use are included in the vendor’s contract for ongoing eligibility. If guarantees are only present for some of the stages, the software may not allow the dentist to be eligible for all stages. One question customers must ask is whether the clinical software (or EDR) is meaningful use compliant, or if additional modules are needed to attest. Some vendors offer separate meaningful use reporting tools or package EDRs with meaningful use software that is separate from the clinical software.</p>
						<p>Vendors can agree to document and share changes to the meaningful use reporting across updates and upgrades, which can be helpful to practices. Then a user can quickly discern changes and functionality across versions. The timeframe and scope of revisions to the software should be specified, along with timeline for eligibility.</p>
                        Key Points:
                        <ul>
                        	<li>Functionality commitment</li>
                            <li>Timing and information around upgrades</li>
                            <li>Certification commitment, and which stages are included</li>
                            <li>Remedies and steps for non-compliance</li>
                            <li>Eligible professional responsibilities and vendor responsibilities</li>
                            <li>Are additional software modules necessary to attest for meaningful use? (Some certified EHR products are not complete EHRs, and the vendors are charging for modules that have been certified to meet MU criteria.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b><i>Recommendation:</i></b> The contract should include steps and remedies for non-compliance both for present and future stages of meaningful use. Remedies can include such provisions as service credits, financial penalties, or refund of the cost of software.</p>

                     </div>
                     <div id="collapseTwo1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                       <div class="panel-body"><p>Functionality means that the software works as it should, in accordance with what the user documentation specifies for performance. This is usually guaranteed for a period of time after go-live. If bugs, errors or problems occur, the contract needs to include specific timeframes and steps for communication and fixes.</p>
                       Key Points:
                       <ul>
                       	<li>Functionality commitment across changes such as versions, regulatory requirements and software interfaces</li>
                        <li>The standard for functionality, which may be in the help files, reference materials or other documentation</li>
                        <li>Timeframes for fixing functionality, and remedies if timeframes are not met</li>
                        <li>Who can install the software under the warranty, including whether a practice member can install or if an authorized/certified representative must install</li>
                        <li>Eligible professional responsibility</li>
                        <li>Warranties about performance. Not all vendors will guarantee ongoing performance, due to interactions and complexity, but dental practices should ask about such warranties</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><b><i>Recommendation:</i></b> If a vendor cannot repair functionality after the timeframe has elapsed, remedies should be spelled out.</p>
                       </div>
                     </div>
                   </div>

                       <div class="panel-body"><p>In addition to meaningful use, many other regulations are critical for dental software. Regulatory conditions change over time, as rules and circumstances alter. Regulatory compliance in a contract is a commitment by the vendor to address and meet future regulations, such as changes to HIPAA or other regulations. A key question for practices to ask is whether that compliance upgrade is free to the practice, or if there will be additional costs or fees. The timeline for vendors to reach compliance should also be specified.</p>
                       <p><b><i>Recommendation:</i></b> Ensure that vendor commits to regulatory compliance in a specified period of time, preferably at no extra cost.</p>
                       </div>

                       <div class="panel-body"><p>Standards refer to specific kinds of functionality, for instance, interoperability or the ability to export to registries or accept input from device interfaces. Contracts usually spell out compliance for existing standards, and specify which standards are met by the software. In addition, the practice may want the vendor to commit to meeting new or revised standards. That may be difficult, particularly if the standards have not yet been completed. However, understanding how the vendor will work to remain in compliance with industry standards over time as well as government and certification standards, is key to ongoing software functionality. Practices should ask if standards compliance is included in regular upgrades or if there are additional fees. If a practice has unusual interfaces, the contract should specify any charges for a specific interface that does not meet an industry standard.</p>
                       Key Points:
                       <ul>
                       	<li>Health information exchange requirements</li>

                        <li>Data exchange for referrals, dental laboratories and to physicians</li>
                        <li>State registries for clinical research, if applicable</li>
                        <li>Imaging equipment and devices</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><b><i>Recommendation:</i></b> Make sure vendor is committed to keeping up with evolving industry standards.</p>

                       <p>Some software has remote disabling capability, allowing vendors to disable the software intentionally. This would be most likely during a dispute. If possible, a contract should specify that vendors will not include such mechanisms. If intentional disabling mechanisms are part of the software, the circumstances under which a vendor has the right to disable software functionality should be specified.</p>
                       <p><b><i>Recommendation:</i></b> Vendor agrees they will not insert intentionally disabling mechanisms in their software. Disputes can be resolved through contract provisions, rather than disabling customer software.</p>

                         <p>All software is upgraded and updated. However, different vendors support those upgrades in different ways. Dentists need to ask whether upgrades are included in vendor support, or if there are additional charges. In addition, dentists need to know if upgrades happen automatically, or if they need to take steps to implement those changes. The upgrade cycle and dates for communication from the vendor about changes to the software should also be clearly stated.</p>

						<p>This type of provision is helpful to define what an update, enhancement, or new release is so there is no confusion, especially around additional charges.

Ask a vendor for their general programming or version release roadmap to understand timing and available features/functionality.

Some clauses provide for a period of time where the price is frozen before increases kick in.  Sometimes there will be a cap on the amount these fees can increase for each period.</p>

						<p>Vendor fee increases may be dictated by external factors, such as third party licensing. In those cases, vendors (and their clients) may be at the mercy of the third party vendors’ pricing policies. One potential standard for limiting fee increases on support/maintenance agreements is tied to economic indicators. This helps providers budget for recurring costs.  For items that can have caps, increases may be based on an inflation index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a multiple of the index.</p>

                         <p>Termination rights can be for a number of reasons, but are typically for breach of contract by either side. Generally, either party may terminate the agreement, although written notice is usually required within a specified timeframe.

						<p>In most cases, the customer will be transitioning to another vendor. Upon termination or expiration of agreements, a vendor will usually provide read-only and/or print access to selected data as required by HIPAA. However, it is helpful for the vendor to agree to provide assistance in converting data to a new system (typically at a standard hourly rate). It may also be helpful to agree that the customer will be provided with structured data in an industry standard format. Recognize that this kind of system conversion does not begin until after termination, so confirm there is a time for customers to continue running the system for a defined period of time, and to receive support, for some period after termination</p>

                         <p>Data schema are representations of the underlying structure of data, detailing how information is organized in the database. When developing interfaces, transitioning systems or accessing information throughout the software, a data schema can be critical. Some vendors provide tools specifically for these purposes, but in some scenarios having direct knowledge of the underlying data schema is critical to ongoing operations and analytics. In particular, upgrades to the data schema that may occur behind the scenes of the user interface may alter functionality.</p>
						<p>Customers should discuss with vendors whether data schemas are proprietary, and if so, whether or not they have access to the documentation. Some vendors will provide data schemas as long as customers assure confidentiality.</p>
