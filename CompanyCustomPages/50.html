The software displays all planned treatments and allows practices to log, write, and print prescriptions. Changes and alterations to images and data are all tracked for auditing purposes.</p>

			<p>Patient history components include a customizable health history interview built into the software, with free text entry capability and commenting for unusual cases. Multiple historical versions can be maintained for a single patient, and the medication record is also stored in Denticon, along with relevant procedure and diagnostic codes. Patient information (including allergies) propagates throughout the software.</p>

			<p>Denticon software complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Hierarchical access allows dentists to limit information visibility. The software also includes important documentation like consent, treatment, home care information, medication orders, post-treatment and education forms for practice use.</p></div>

Images are captured with a digital sensor, which allows for immediate viewing. Images are then saved on a local hard drive and uploaded to the cloud on a schedule determined by the practice. Every picture taken is automatically saved, and can be sent electronically to other dentists, specialists, or insurers.</div>

Tracking of broken appointments allows for productivity and loss planning, with an audit trail for modified appointments. Future production reports allow forecasting and planning. Default appointment types allow practices to schedule six month or annual appointments and continuing care, and print appropriate cards or letters. Lists of patients due to be seen can be compiled by time period, payment status and other criteria.</p>

			<p>Schedules can also be generated for multiple providers, groups of providers or a clinic as a whole, and can be arranged in blocks, according to patterns or by percentages. Overrides for double booking are allowed. Patient and provider scheduling concerns are all tracked, and the treatment plan directly interfaces with the scheduling, which also notes patient financial information. Lab and outsourced work are also visible.</p></div>

Simplify data entry with procedure codes that automatically generate fees and payments tracked by ADA procedure code.</p>

			<p>Keep up with ever-changing patient and insurer information with easy transfer of balances and the ability to bill insurers under a provider’s name. Track estimated benefit and patient balances, with automated thank-yous for complete payments.</p>
